# Our Puzzle Log 30-03-2017
## Day 1 (Tuesday):
---
_Here is a list of MVP level puzzle ideas that we came up with, for the ‘micro bit’:_
1.	Chess
2.	Q20
3.	Dodge
4.	Tron bike
5.	Snakes game
6.	Maze
7.	Black Jack
8.	High or Low

Out of these ideas, we came to a conclusion of creating the: Dodge, Black jack, High or Low… as three mini puzzles. These were are MVP puzzles that we had collectively decided to create.
On top of deciding the different puzzles to create, we also discussed the ideas of how we may be able to improve our different mini puzzles. For example: we explored the idea of maybe having a step counter which could be used in the micro bit to allow it to calculate speed of our movement (for the Tron bike). We found that the step counter was very sensitive when placed in our pockets, during our testing process. This was due to the ball inside the accelerometer moved/ shook quite a lot on each step. However, we found that if the micro bit was placed nearer our feet (ankle height), the steps counted were more accurate, but this means it’s more susceptible to breaking or being damaged.
Here is a data table of number of actual steps taken, compared to the number of steps recoded on the micro bit:

| Number of actual steps taken:  | Number of steps recorded on the micro bit: |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 30  | 26  |
| 30  | 28  |
| 50  | 50  |
| 60  | 58  |

(during the process of taking these results, we found that we were getting exactly half the actual steps, therefore we just edited the code and just rather than adding 1 during each step, we changed it to ‘add 2’ per step, which is equivalent to multiplying the end result by 2)

## Day 2 (Wednesday):
---
Today we looked at finishing each of these puzzles and decided what we could do to improve them, or incorporate them into one game (possibly).

For example: we looked at how to configure the accelerometer in the micro bit to allow us to programme more interactive puzzles for the user (in the ‘dodge’ and ‘high or low’ puzzles)
We also looked at improving the webpage design for the place were these puzzles would be posted.
As we were away from 2:00pm to 6:30pm for a tour in the History of computers building, we weren't able to continue working on our puzzles.
