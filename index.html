							You need to guess whether the next number will be higher or lower than the current one.
						</p>

						<p>
							<br>How to play:
							
The game will start as soon as the MicroBit is connected to power.
A number will scroll across the LEDs and then will stay on the LEDS. If there is a zero, this is actually 10 but the one doesn't fit on the grid!
To choose higher or lower you use the accelerometer.
To choose higher tilt the left side of the MicroBit downwards.
To choose lower tilt the right side of the Microbit downwards.
Once titled return the MicroBit so that it's level.
If you were correct, a tick will show and then another number and so on.
If you were incorrect, a cross will show and then your score will scroll across the screen.
Once the game ends it will restart.

						<p>
							You have to follow the screen and do exactly what it says.
						</p>

						<p>
							Instructions:
							The game will start the second the power is connected to the MicroBit.
3 characters will scroll from right to left across the LEDs; using the key below you need to input these characters,in order, back to the MicroBit.
The game uses the MicroBit's accelerometer and buttons to make 28 different inputs: A-Z, BACKSPACE and FINISHED.
It may take a few tries to get used to the input system but when you see the character appear you should return the MicroBit to a level position.
Tilting the top of the MicroBit downwards is UP,
Tilting the bottom downwards is DOWN, 
Tilting the right downwards is RIGHT,
Tiliting the left downwards is LEFT.
When pressing the buttons, press down and release, and when pressing them twice in a row make sure not to be too fast. However you will need to press for the second time in about less than a second apart to the first.
If you make a mistake when inputting you can use Backspace to remove the latest character.
When you have inputted your characters, use Finished and then the MicroBit will either show a tick (correct) or a cross (incorrect)
Then 3 more characters will scroll across the screen and it repeats.
						</p>
						<p>
							Key: [Character] [Direction] [Button(s)]
U=Up
L=Left
R=Right
D=Down
AB= A and B at the same time
AA or BB= Double press A or B
ABAB= Double press AB
						</p>
						<p>
							A U, means the character 'A' is produced if you tilt the top of the MicroBit downwards.
B U A, mean the character 'B' is produced if you tilt the top of the MicroBit downward AND press button A.
